SPARX ESPORTS is a professional Swiss esports organisation with teams across multiple games. Their goal is to become a widely recognised esports organisation and participate in major global tournaments. They’ve been developing innovative campaigns with partners by exploring new technologies, especially in Web3 and AR/VR.&#x20;

SPARX already has a strong network of players across _Counter-Strike_ and _Rocket League_, but they’ve decided to enter the fold of Riot Games’ competitive tactical shooter _Valorant_ with their promising new female roster, SPARX Secret, sponsored by GameDAO.

GameDAO will work together with SPARX as their team partner, utilising new technology to create innovative and new ways to integrate esports fans into the organisation. Namely, GameDAO will lend its DAO tooling to SPARX Esports to create a fan engagement platform, featuring rewards and incentives, through the invocation of a Guild.
