# ðŸ•¹ The WASD Gaming Accelerator

GameDAOâ€™s gaming accelerator, The WASD Fund, will support and mentor small game development companies to reach their true potential. Our vision is to use the WASD Fund as a way to give back to the community of game developers by offering them a new way to achieve funding and support, as well as guidance through the world of Web3 and beyond.

Through the WASD Fund, we hope to onboard many new games - both web2 and web3 - to the GameDAO ecosystem. This will allow them to leverage our community, make use of our DAO tooling to decentralise&#x20;

**The WASD Fund is currently in early stages, so expect to see more after Q2 2023.**
