# GameDAO

**Good to know:** providing a brief overview of your product and its core use cases is a great place to start with product docs. Your product might seem obvious to you â€“ you made it! However, to others, even folks who are trying your product after reading your site or getting a sales demo, it can still be unclear. This is your chance to clarify your product and set the right expectations!

[GameDAO](https://gamedao.co) is an experimental crowd-coordination and -fundraising organisation currently running on [zero.io](https://zero.io), a [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network) / [substrate](https://substrate.io) based network for video games.

While the platform as a whole focusses on ease-of-use of finance and governance protocols (e.g. grants or lending), there are more complex scenarios which in turn require a deeper understanding and additional preparation in advance (e.g. for fractionalised equity).

These protocols create a low barrier, community governed fundraising platform to involve funding contributors in project coordination to increase mutual trust due to shared interests and increased transparency. This allows for early stage market proof and loyalty through ownership. Furthermore this contributes to individual freedom and the development of more sustainable business models of video games.

By utilisation of innovative coordination methods, like quadratic voting and creation of loan protocols featuring alternative collaterals, like NFTs, GameDAO will become the protocol directly connecting creators, players, publishers and investors.
