# ðŸ§‘ðŸŽ“ Beeblebrox Testing

In order to interact with the chain without frontend do the following steps to achieve an end2end result:

### 1. Configure Beeblebrox DEV Chain

first you need to open your polkadot.js.org wallet and add the beeblebrox endpoint as a custom node.\


1. click the network selector on the top left
2. scroll down to the bottom
3. click DEVELOPMENT
4. add as custom endpoint `wss://beeblebrox.zero.io/node`
5. click switch on the top to access the new endpoint\
   ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (7).png>)\
   \


{% hint style="danger" %}
Recommendation for all actions is: to have a separate browser window opened which shows the Network --> Explorer in polkadot.js.org. Have the "recent events" in your view when you perform transactions to copy response hashes out of it.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

2. select `control` pallet and `orgTreasury(256)` in the right dropdown

6. switch pallet to `tokens` and `accounts(AccountId, u32)`&#x20;
7. enter the copied Treasury hash into the `accountId`
8. toggle off  `include option`
9. click the "+" to submit the query
