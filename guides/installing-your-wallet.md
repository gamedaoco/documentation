# 💌 Install Polkadot wallet and create an Account

## Overview

These are the steps required to use GameDAO on our testnet. This process is a bit technical and will become easier in the process:

1. Get Polkadot{.js} wallet and create an account
2. Switch Polkadot{.js} to ZERO test network
3. Get some ZERO, GAME and PLAY tokens

## 1. Get Polkadot{.js} wallet and create an account

Polkadot{.js} is available as a browser plugin for Firefox and Chrome. Please download the plugin here: [https://polkadot.js.org/extension/](https://polkadot.js.org/extension/).\


1. To make things easier, we suggest pinning the extension to your browser toolbar:\

\
2\. Click the Polkadot{.js} icon on the plugin bar of your browser.\
Read the info message and click “Understood, let me continue”\
You will see the following:\

3\. Click the "+" button in the middle or choose the small plus button on the top right and click “Create new account”.

A seed consisting of 12 random words will be created for you and displayed:\

4\. These 12 words are very important. Make sure to back up these 12 words safely, secret and secure somewhere, e.g. on paper.

Follow these steps to make sure you do it right: https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-account-generation.

If you cannot access your Polkadot{.js} wallet for any reason you can only recover your account with your seed via “add account menu” by selecting “Import account from pre-existing seed”.



5\. Account Name & Password

* The account name is chosen by yourself. The password is used to encrypt your account information. The password will always be requested when signing a transaction.
* The password does not protect your seed phrase. If you give someone your 12 words seed, they will be able to access your wallet without knowing your password.
* **Never share your password or seed**\

\
6\. Check the checkbox “I have saved my mnemonic seed safely” and click the “Next step” button to see this view:\

* Leave Network on “Allow use on any chain”.
* Add a descriptive name for your account (e.g. myWallet)
* Set a password and repeat the password.\
  \
  Congrats, your wallet is all set up! :+1:\
  Your wallet address works on any chain in the Polkadot ecosystem.

1. Go to [https://polkadot.js.org/apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps)
2. Click on the top left icon (here Polkadot):\

   ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91988132/145686934-17cb4c7f-f7de-43d7-b08b-f0aa5a7f57d2.png)\

4. Scroll to the botton to find “Zero”:\

5. Select Zero Network and scroll back to the top and click the "Switch" button::\
   ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91988132/145687185-dcc98218-cb28-453d-841f-3c0334e2efc1.png)\

6. After Reload you should be connected to the Zero test network:\
   ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91988132/145687202-d8848349-3f64-4783-a34d-8d107c428ae7.png)\

7. Update Metadata to ensure you have the latest metadata by clicking Settings > Metadata > Update Metadata
8. Copy your new ZERO wallet address by navigating to Accounts > Accounts in the top navigation. In the content area you will find your wallet:\
   ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91988132/145687591-922d1745-8b5b-49b6-af1b-1e775e64dd1d.png)\

9. Click the wallet name (here “MYWALLET (EXTENSION)”). A popup opens on the top right displaying your ZERO wallet address (ZERO addresses start with a 3).
10. Select and copy this address as you will need it to obtain ZERO tokens.

## 3. Get some ZERO, GAME and PLAY tokens

So far GameDAO runs on the ZERO test network. This means to fully test all current and coming functionalities, you will need:

* ZERO token to cover network fees
* GAME token to access GameDAO protocols and take part in governance
* PLAY token as a stable payment means to send and receive payments

As this is an open testnet, there are still no monetary values being moved around, but using your account on the network may result in certain rewards and drops in the future, to appreciate you helping us in building a better protocol.

To get all of the above token, you may use the faucet integrated into our discord here:&#x20;

1. Join our Discord channel to obtain some ZERO tokens: [https://discord.gg/P7NHWGzJ7r](https://discord.gg/P7NHWGzJ7r)
2. Find the faucet channel in the category ZERO MULTIVERSE:\
   ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (3) (1).png>)\

3. Enter in the chat the following statement:\
   `!fc get #your walletaddress#`\
   For this wallet in the example the statement to post in the faucet channel would be:\
   `!fc get 3aVbhhBLSyUVAgy4rzizaF7dY5ZXuVX8bQiDnyGmvzsvXCdi`\
   The faucet bot will send you 10 ZERO, 10 GAME, 10 PLAY.
4. Success, now you can interact with GameDAO :money\_with\_wings:.

If you don’t know your wallet address follow the steps described in "Switch Polkadot{.js} to ZERO test network" to find out.
