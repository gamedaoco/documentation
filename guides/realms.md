# üçí Realms

GameDAO provides easy mechanisms to qualify projects in various regards: Like in open worlds we are working with the idea of Realms which cluster certain aspects of projects. This results in two main categories: open and discover.&#x20;

### Open

Any creator can deploy a project to be listed in the open category. By nature, projects in the open category can deliver a wide variety of qualities.

### Discover

Projects in the discover category are handpicked by the community: Therefore they qualify for direct support by the GameDAO Treasury, Launch Support and listing in the Storefront.
