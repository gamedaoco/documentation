# ðŸª„ From DAO to Campaign

## The basics

A DAO is the minimum primitive you need to establish to get organised with your community. Whether you are setting up a working group for your project team or want to interact with hundreds of community members and contributors.

## Creating a Wallet and Claim an Identity

You have to do this and then that.

## Creating an organisation
