# ðŸª„ From DAO to Campaign

## The basics

A DAO is the minimum primitive you need to establish to get organised with your collaborators and community. Whether you are setting up a guild, a working group for your project team or want to interact with hundreds of community members and contributors.

## 1. Create a Wallet and Claim an Identity

Set up your polkadot.js wallet and obtain some ZERO token from the faucet bot in our Discord Channel as described in [previous chapter](installing-your-wallet.md) and set an on-chain identity like this:

1. go to [https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/accounts](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/accounts) and select an account from below and find the three dots on the right:\
   ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (5).png>)
2. click "Set on-chain identity":\
   ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png>)\

3. fill some details like display name and email or twitter:\
   ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (6).png>)
4. Click Set Identity and&#x20;
5. Sign the transaction by clicking "Sign & Submit" and entering your wallet password.
6. If it did not work, make sure you have some ZERO amount on your wallet.

## Creating an organisation

Now its time to create your first DAO.

1. Go to [https://beta.gamedao.co/](https://beta.gamedao.co) and enter the app
2. Connect your wallet on the top right connect button
3. Click  on Organisations on the left navigation to get to the Organisations List Page
4. Click the green "New DAO" button
5. Fill a name and an email address
6. Upload some nice free to use images representing the DAO you are setting up
7. &#x20;Write a short description about the purpose of the Organisation
8. add a website and a code repository if you have some related to your Organisation
9. **IMPORTANT**: The Controller Account address needs to be a wallet address in ZERO format. The holder of the Controller Account address is the admin of the DAO. You can use your current address (eg. copy by clicking the heart icon next to your wallet on the top right) and paste it into the form
10. **IMPORTANT**: The Treasury Account address also needs to be a wallet address in ZERO format. The Treasury Account address is the address receiving funds from fundraising campaigns and fees. This address may not be the same address as the Controller Account address. Therefore you will need a second address to setup your Organisation. \
    If you do not have a second address you can create one in your polkadot.js browser plugin repeating the steps in[ Install Polkadot wallet and create an Account](installing-your-wallet.md).  Add your second address into the Treasury Account address field
11. Choose how do you want to control member access by selecting&#x20;
    1. Open (everyone can join until member limit is reached)
    2. Invitation (members need to be on a whitelist to enter the Organisation) (_<mark style="color:purple;">coming soon</mark>_)
    3. Proposal (users need to apply to become a member and existing users can accept or decline through voting) (_<mark style="color:purple;">coming soon</mark>_)
12. select a Fee Model
    1. no fees (free entry)
    2. reserve (members need to lock the amount of token configured in Membership Fee)
    3. transfer (the Membership Fee is transferred to the Organisation Treasury account address  on entry)
13. Add a Membership Fee (ZERO) which will apply for "reserve" or "transfer" Fee Models
14. Click Create Organisation and sign the transaction
15. Your DAO is created \
