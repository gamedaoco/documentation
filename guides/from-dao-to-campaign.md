# ðŸª„ From DAO to Campaign

## The basics

A DAO is the minimum primitive you need to establish to get organised with your collaborators and community. Whether you are setting up a guild, a working group for your project team or want to interact with hundreds of community members and contributors.

## 1. Create a Wallet and Claim an Identity

Set up your polkadot.js wallet and obtain some ZERO token from the faucet bot in our Discord Channel as described in [previous chapter](installing-your-wallet.md) and set an on-chain identity like this:

1. go to [https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/accounts](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/accounts) and select an account from below and find the three dots on the right:\
   ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (5).png>)
2. click "Set on-chain identity":\
   ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png>)\

3. fill some details like display name and email or twitter:\
   ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (6).png>)
4. Click Set Identity and&#x20;
5. sign the transaction by clicking "Sign & Submit" and entering your wallet password.
6. If it did not work, make sure you have some ZERO amount on your wallet.
