# üèõ Governance & Tokenomics

{% hint style="info" %}
**Good to know:** Splitting your product into fundamental concepts, objects, or areas can be a great way to let readers deep dive into the concepts that matter most to them.

$GAME is the GameDAO platform's native token. It's used exclusively for accessing the platform and for governance features, like voting on or creating proposals for things such as treasury management, membership features and more. However, there are other tokens used on the platform. These tokenomics are explained in the following subsections.

### Token Economics

GameDAO as a platform utilises three separate tokens for access, governance and transactions.

* $GAME for access and governance&#x20;
* $aUSD, Acala's stablecoin tied to the USD, used for purchases.
* $ZERO, the underlying network‚Äôs transactional token.

#### $GAME

$GAME will follow a 3 year token distribution.

### Storefront

GameDAO will have a marketplace, offered through ZERO. The Storefront will use licensing protocols so that users can trade video games and assets directly. Here‚Äôs some examples of what you‚Äôll be able to trade on the Storefront:

* In-game skins and cosmetics&#x20;

Buy, sell and trade in-game digital assets such as skins and cosmetics directly with your friends or other GameDAO users. This will allow a game's asset economy to be separated from the game itself, increasing user freedoms and allow the true ownership of game assets.

* Access tokens for beta tests or special communities

The storefront is also the place to trade things like beta keys, or keys that give you access to certain communities or DAOs. For example, if you've been awarded a few beta keys from crowdfunding games on GameDAO but won't have the time to play them, you can resell them on The Storefront and potentially profit from your contributions.

* Game expansion passes and add-ons, and Video games themselves!

Currently, game licenses do not give the holder true ownership. Rather, they are constrained by laws to be limited. This means that should the platform cease to operate or be overtaken by a competitor, you could permanently lose access to that game license-whether it was for a full AAA video game or just an expansion pack. GameDAO allows a way around this, as the licenses can be built into the underlying decentralised technology and traded natively through peer-to-peer transactions, directly hosted on your wallet.

In other words, even if the GameDAO platform were to disappear, you'd still have the game license in your wallet and would still be able to use it as you wish.

### Ownership

The last point will allow the true ownership & trading of video games via direct peer-to-peer transactions, hosted in your wallet. That means no more games taking up space in your library with no playtime‚Äîusers could resell them or trade them with friends-just like the old days but using new, peer-to-peer digital technology.

This would also have application for game publishers and developers, giving them immediate and easy access to more sustainable and efficient models of distribution via issuing games directly to people's wallets.

Users on the GameDAO platform could also come to co-own games, organisations and groups. DAOs being decentralised and democratic means everyone has a fair say, and this could result in interesting outcomes such as a DAO voting to hand over a game and its infrastructure to the community, where they could continue to maintain it as a decentralised group.
