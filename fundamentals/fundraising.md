# ðŸ“© Voting & Coordination

GameDAO makes coordinating your gaming clans, orgs and goals easy through the platform's DAO tooling.&#x20;

## Proposals

You can create and vote on proposals in DAOs on the platform by visiting the **Voting** panel. Proposals are suggestions made by a community member which can then be voted on by the rest of the DAO. Dependent on the proposal, these usually result in some action being taken. For example, a user could create a proposal to add additional incentives to a fundraising campaign. If successful, then the desirable outcome will be changed by the system.

There are three types of proposal used on **GameDAO:**

**General Proposals**: Suggestions or amendments to a DAO or campaign\
**Withdrawal Proposals**: Proposals to withdraw funds from the treasury to a wallet\
**Spending Proposals**: Proposals for a DAO treasury to spend funds on something

### **How to Create a Proposal:**

1. Click on **Voting** in the left navigation to jump to the governance page.
2. Click " + New Proposal" on the top right to see the proposal form.
3. Select the desired DAO&#x20;
4. Choose the desired Proposal Type from the dropdown box
5. Fill in the information of your Proposal. The Voting Type will be determined by the governing DAO.
6. Click Publish Proposal, then sign and submit your transaction
7. The voting is active. DAO members and contributors can now vote/comment on your proposal.
8. If the proposal passes by a majority vote, it will be implemented by the DAO.

### Who Can Vote?

In order to vote and engage in governance, you must own and stake $GAME tokens. Users that do so can do the following on the platform:

* Vote on proposals related to GameDAO (e.g. members, protocol upgrades)
* Participate in and initiate public proposals
* Join ongoing fundraising campaigns and DAOs
* Initiate a campaign for your own interest (e.g. as a creator)&#x20;

GameDAO will make use of a variety of voting mechanisms. For example, Simple / Weighted Majority or Quadratic Voting. DAOs can decide which they use, dependent on their needs.

## Coordination and Lifecycle Support

GameDAO allows game creators, developers, and organisations to coordinate their important goals, raise funds, and gain full lifecycle support by directly integrating communities into their businesses.

### Fundraising Campaigns

The Fundraising Phase is fairly straightforward with four steps:

1. Set up Account + Identity
2. Select Fundraising + Coordination Protocol
3. GameDAO Council Approval
4. Launch

During Fundraising, creators will promote their campaign and collect supporters and funds. If a campaign reaches the desired minimum cap, the phase is successful.

Funds provided by contributors are locked until the end of the campaign. Depending on the campaignâ€™s outcome, funds will either be returned to the contributors (unsuccessful) or stored in a campaign escrow, which is processed in coordination.

After a successful fundraising campaign, the DAO moves into the coordination phase.

### Coordination Phase

Fundraising campaigns can be created with or without governance, however they are always created using one of four baselines which will structure how the funds are released: **Grant, Prepaid, Loan or Shares.**&#x20;

**Without Campaign Governance**

1. Grants are paid immediately to the creator.
2. Prepaid campaigns release payments on an automatic time schedule chosen by the creator&#x20;
3. Loans will be released immediately to the creator, based on the terms
4. Shares will be immediately released, but may imply further regulatory requirements.

#### **With Campaign Governance:**

All participants of a campaign will automatically become part of the DAO where they can propose and approve (withdrawal) votes.

When creating a campaign, the creator can propose either milestones or deliverables which will release funds with the DAO's approval. Any participant of the DAO can create proposals to interact with the campaign creators in a transparent and coordinated fashion.

**Governance** provides coordinated exit from a campaign during coordination phase, when deliverables or milestone quality do not meet the expectations of the DAO members. This feature, called 'Rage Quit' results in the return of the remaining funds to the contributors, based on their contributions.

These tools mean measurable quality, protection and guarantees for contributors as well as higher success rates for funding campaigns.
