# üñ• Get Connected

## Overview

These are the steps required to use GameDAO:

1. Install the Polkadot{.js} wallet and create an account
2. Switch Polkadot{.js} to the ZERO network
3. Acquire some $GAME tokens

## 1. Get Polkadot{.js} wallet and create an account

{% hint style="info" %}
A digital wallet, much like a physical wallet, is used to keep your currencies and tokens safe and accessible. You need a wallet to acquire tokens and digital currencies, as well as to send, receive, and trade digital assets using decentralised technology.
{% endhint %}

GameDAO and ZERO Network operate on Polkadot. For this reason, you'll need a Polkadot wallet to get started.

Polkadot{.js} is available as a browser plugin for Firefox and Chrome. \
Download the plugin here: [https://polkadot.js.org/extension/](https://polkadot.js.org/extension/).

1. To make things easier, you can pin the extension to your taskbar:\
   ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91988132/145686170-9a7e0b7a-e8d6-41a9-a185-9e80efc45b14.png)

\
&#x20;2\. Click the Polkadot{.js} icon on the plugin bar of your browser.\
Read the info message and click ‚ÄúUnderstood, let me continue‚Äù\
You'll see the following:\

3\. Click the "+" button in the middle or choose the small plus button on the top right and click ‚ÄúCreate new account‚Äù.

A seed consisting of 12 random words will be created for you and displayed:\

4\. These 12 words are your wallet's seed phrase, and they're very important. Make sure to back up these 12 words safely, secret and secure somewhere. We suggest you write them down on a piece of paper, or in a journal that you keep somewhere safe.

You can follow these steps to make sure you're on the right track: https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-account-generation.

If you can't access your Polkadot{.js} wallet for any reason, you can only recover your account with your 12-word seed phrase via ‚Äúadd account menu‚Äù by selecting ‚ÄúImport account from pre-existing seed‚Äù.



5\. Account Name & Password

* The account name is chosen by yourself. The password is used to encrypt your account information - just like with any other platform account. The password will always be requested when signing a transaction to keep your tokens secure.
* The password does not protect your seed phrase. If you give someone your 12 words seed, they will be able to access your wallet without knowing your password.
* **Never share your password or seed phrase**\
  \

\
6\. Tick the checkbox ‚ÄúI have saved my mnemonic seed safely‚Äù and click the ‚ÄúNext step‚Äù button to see this view:\
\

* Leave Network on ‚ÄúAllow use on any chain‚Äù.
* Add a descriptive name for your account (e.g. myWallet)
* Set a password and repeat the password.\
  \
  Congrats, your wallet is all set up!\
  Your wallet address works on any chain in the Polkadot ecosystem.

4. Scroll to the botton to find ‚ÄúZero‚Äù:\

6. After Reload you should be connected to the Zero test network:\
   ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91988132/145687202-d8848349-3f64-4783-a34d-8d107c428ae7.png)\

7. Update Metadata to ensure you have the latest metadata by clicking Settings > Metadata > Update Metadata
8. Copy your new ZERO wallet address by navigating to Accounts > Accounts in the top navigation. In the content area you will find your wallet:\
   ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91988132/145687591-922d1745-8b5b-49b6-af1b-1e775e64dd1d.png)\

9. Click the wallet name (here ‚ÄúMYWALLET (EXTENSION)‚Äù). A popup opens on the top right displaying your ZERO wallet address (ZERO addresses start with a 3).
10. Select and copy this address as you will need it to obtain ZERO tokens.

## 3. Get some ZERO, GAME and PLAY tokens

So far GameDAO runs on the ZERO test network. This means to fully test all current and coming functionalities, you will need:

* ZERO token to cover network fees
* GAME token to access GameDAO protocols and take part in governance
* PLAY token as a stable payment means to send and receive payments

As this is an open testnet, there are still no monetary values being moved around, but using your account on the network may result in certain rewards and drops in the future, to appreciate you helping us in building a better protocol.

To get all of the above token, you may use the faucet integrated into our discord here:&#x20;

1. Join our Discord channel to obtain some ZERO tokens: [https://discord.gg/P7NHWGzJ7r](https://discord.gg/P7NHWGzJ7r)
2. Go to press start channel in ENTER GAMEDAO category: \
   ![](../.gitbook/assets/image.png)
3. Click the moneybag icon :moneybag:to get the Web3 Weirdo role so that you can use the faucet:![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (5).png>)
4. Find the faucet channel in the category ZERO NETWORK:\
   ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (3) (1) (1).png>)\

5. Enter in the chat the following statement:\
   `!loot get #your walletaddress#`\
   For this wallet in the example the statement to post in the faucet channel would be:\
   `!loot get 3aVbhhBLSyUVAgy4rzizaF7dY5ZXuVX8bQiDnyGmvzsvXCdi`\
   The faucet bot will send you 10 ZERO, 10 GAME, 10 PLAY.
6. Success, now you can interact with GameDAO :money\_with\_wings:.
