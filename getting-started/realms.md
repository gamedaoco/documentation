# üåê Realms

If you're a game developer using ZERO Network or making use of GameDAO's platform, you'll have access to Realms.

These are simple mechanisms to qualify your projects and cluster them into segments. On ZERO, you'll be able to manage aspects and analytics of your game.&#x20;

On GameDAO, similar to a namespace, your **Realms** will provide information about your **DAO** and assets belonging to it, allowing you to easily manage and visualise data relating to your campaign or organisation.

Realms are divided into two categories, Open and Discover

### Open

Any creator can deploy a project to be listed in the open category. By nature, projects in the open category can deliver a wide variety of qualities.

### Discover

Projects in the discover category are handpicked by the community through a curation process: They qualify for direct support by the GameDAO Treasury, Launch Support and listing in the Storefront.
